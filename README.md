# Sorting-Searching-Algorithms


This repo is meant to contain the algorithms for searching and sorting algorithms in every language .


# Need for this repository ? 
- This repository is meant to be a one destination for all a programmer to refer to all the searching algorithms and sorting algortihms. 
- This repository will contain the algorithms in all different programming languages.
- Intention is to create a unified all in one place for all the sorting and searching algorithms.
