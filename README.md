# Sorting-Searching-Algorithms


This repo is meant to contain the algorithms for searching and sorting algorithms in every language .


# Need for this repository ? 
- This repository is meant to be a one destination for all a programmer to refer to all the searching algorithms and sorting algortihms. 
- This repository will contain the algorithms in all different programming languages.
- Intention is to create a unified all in one place for all the sorting and searching algorithms.


## Searching Algortihms
- [Binary Search](https://github.com/4N1Z/Sorting-Searching-Algorithms/tree/main/Searching/Binary-Search)
- [Linear Search](https://github.com/4N1Z/Sorting-Searching-Algorithms/tree/main/Searching/Linear-Search)

# How to contribute ?

1. Take a look at the existing Issues or create a new issue! 
2. Fork the Repo. Then, create a branch for any issue that you are working on. Finally, commit your work.
3. Before commiting make sure you are addding the algorithm in the correct folder. Incase a you are adding the algorithm in a new language make sure to create a new folder having the name of that language. 
4. Create a Pull Request (PR), which will be promptly reviewed and given suggestions for improvements by the community.

## ‚≠ê HOW TO MAKE A PULL REQUEST:

**1.** Start by making a Fork of the [**Sorting-Searching-Algorithms**](https://github.com/AnirudhDaya/Sorting-Searching-Algorithms) repository. Click on the <a href="https://github.com/4N1Z/Sorting-Searching-Algorithms/fork"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/G4z1kEe.png" height="21" width="21"></a>Fork symbol at the top right corner.

**2.** Clone your new fork of the repository in the terminal/CLI on your computer with the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-github-username>/Sorting-Searching-Algorithms
```

**3.** Navigate to the newly created Sorting-Searching-Algorithms project directory:

```bash
cd Sorting-Searching-Algorithms
```

**4.** Set upstream command:

```bash
git remote add upstream https://github.com/4N1Z/Sorting-Searching-Algorithms.git
```

**5.** Create a new branch:

```bash
git checkout -b YourBranchName
```

**6.** Sync your fork or your local repository with the origin repository:

- In your forked repository, click on "Fetch upstream"
- Click "Fetch and merge"

**7.** Make your changes to the source code.

**8.** Stage your changes:

```bash
git add .
```

_or_

```bash
git add "<files_you_have_changed>"
```

**9.** Commit your changes:

```bash
git commit -m "<your_commit_message>"
