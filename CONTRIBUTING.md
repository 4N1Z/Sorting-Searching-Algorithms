4. Create a Pull Request (PR), which will be promptly reviewed and given suggestions for improvements by the community.



### ‚õî Points to be noted üìíüñä :
- The code must be added to the correct folder 
> eg : If you are adding binary search in java, then you should go to folder _search_ / binary_search / then add the code.
- The code must be named after the language the code is coded
> eg: if the code is in java, then name your code as _*in_Java.java*_
