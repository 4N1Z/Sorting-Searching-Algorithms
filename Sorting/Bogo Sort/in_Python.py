bogosort (also known as permutation sort, stupid sort, or slowsort) is a sorting algorithm 
based on the generate and test paradigm. The function successively generates permutations 
of its input  until it finds one that is sorted. It is not considered useful for sorting, 
but may be used for educational purposes, to contrast it with more efficient algorithms.

Time Complexity:
Worst Case : O(âˆž) (since this algorithm has no upper bound)
Average Case: O(n*n!)
Best Case : O(n)(when array given is already sorted)
Auxiliary Space: O(1)
