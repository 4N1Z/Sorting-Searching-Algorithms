## Odd-Even / Brick Sort
This is basically a variation of bubble-sort. This algorithm is divided into two phases-Odd and Even Phase. The algorithm runs until the array elements are sorted and in each iteration two phases occurs-Odd and Even Phases.
In the odd phase, we perform a bubble sort on odd indexed elements and in the even phase, we perform a bubble sort on even indexed elements.

## Complexities
**Time Complexity :** **O(N2)** where, N = Number of elements in the input array.
**Auxiliary Space :** **O(1)**, Just like bubble sort this is also an in-place algorithm.
