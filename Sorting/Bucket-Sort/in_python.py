#Bucket sort is mainly useful when input is uniformly distributed over a range. For example, consider the following problem. 
#A simple way is to apply a comparison based sorting algorithm. 
#The lower bound for Comparison based sorting algorithm (Merge Sort, Heap Sort, Quick-Sort .. etc) is Î©(n Log n), i.e., 
#they cannot do better than nLogn.

#Time Complexity	 
#Best	O(n+k)
#Worst	O(n2)
#Average	O(n)
#Space Complexity	O(n+k)
#Stability	Yes
